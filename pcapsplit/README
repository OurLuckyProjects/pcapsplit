This is a development snapshot of pcapsplit. At this moment pcapsplit is only
capable of splitting pcap files into several smaller pieces. 

Use 

$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ make

in order to compile pcapsplit. You need the development version of libpcap
installed on you system.

The configuration is done via ini files. These files configure all the modules
that pcapsplit uses to split the source file. Each of these modules does have
its on section in within the files. The following modules are currently
implemented:

[size_dumper]
file_prefix=/path/to/file/prefix
size=size in bytes
