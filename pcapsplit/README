This is a development snapshot of pcapsplit. At this moment pcapsplit is only
capable of splitting pcap files into several smaller pieces. 

Use 

$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ make

in order to compile pcapsplit. You need the development version of libpcap
installed on you system.

The configuration is done via ini files. These files configure all the modules
that pcapsplit uses to split the source file. Each of these modules does have
its on section in within the files. The following modules are currently
implemented:

- sizedumper -- Splits a single pcap files into several smaller files. The
  configuration for this module is given like this:

	[size_dumper]
	file_prefix=/path/to/file/prefix
	size=size in bytes
  
  The resulting files will be no bigger than size "size". Some files might be
  smaller because the split is only performed on a packet boundary. Packets
  will not be splitted in the middle of the packet. 
  If a big pcap file is splitted into n smaller files, the resulting output
  files will be named $file_prefix.[0-n].

- filterdumper -- Splits a single pcap files into several files according to
  pcap filter rules. The configuration is performed as follows:

	[filter_dumper]
	file_prefix=/path/to/file/prefix
	numer_of_classes=2

	class1=ip
	filter1="ip"

	class2=ip6
	filter2="ip6"

  The configuration specifies an file prefix in the variable "file_prefix" and
  the number of output classes in "number_of_classes". The variables "class"
  and "filter" need to be existent for every class. For examle, if
  "number_of_classes" is two, there must be the configuration variables
  "class1", "filter1", "class2", "filter2". 
  The string given in "classN" defines the filename of the output pcap file.
  For example, the configuration

	file_prefix='/foo/bar/pcap-'
	class1 = 'ip'

  will result in a pcap filen named '/foo/bar/pcap-ip'. Note that the
  directory for the pcap file MUST exist because pcapsplit does not create any
  directories. The variable "filterN" defines the pcap filter for the class N. 
  The filter format must be in tcpdump(1) format.
